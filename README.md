911 Calls Data Capstone Project
===============================

This project involves analyzing a dataset of 911 calls from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data to understand emergency call trends.

Key Features
------------

### Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and prepared data by parsing timestamps, creating new features (e.g., hour, month, day of the week), and handling missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed call frequency by zip code, township, and reason (EMS, Fire, Traffic), using visualizations such as count plots and heatmaps.

### Time Series Analysis
Investigated trends over time, including daily, monthly, and weekly patterns.

### Data Visualization
Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visual representations of the data.

Tools and Libraries Used
------------------------

- **Top 5 Zipcodes and Townships**: Identified areas with the highest frequency of 911 calls.
- **Reason for Calls**: Created a new feature to categorize calls into EMS, Fire, and Traffic, and analyzed their distribution.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Explored how the frequency of calls varies by time of day, day of the week, and month.
- **Heatmaps and Cluster Maps**: Visualized call patterns to uncover temporal trends and correlations.
